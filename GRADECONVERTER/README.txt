This is a simple program that prompts the user to input the name of a test, the maximum score that could be achieved on the test, and the score that the user received.

The program calculates the user's percentage score by dividing the user's score by the maximum score and multiplying by 100. It then rounds this value to two decimal places and displays it to the user.

The program then uses if-elif statements to determine the user's grade based on their percentage score. If the percentage score is 90 or above, the user gets an A+. If it is between 80 and 89, the user gets an A. The program continues to check the percentage score and assign grades in a similar way until the user's grade is determined. If the percentage score is below 50, the user gets an E.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
